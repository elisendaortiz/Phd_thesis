# About this thesis
This thesis presents a geometric approach to the study of connectivity patterns and dynamical phenomena in real-world complex networks. The main hypothesis of network geometry states that the architecture of real complex networks has a geometric nature. This has been confirmed during the last decade, with a great number of networks from different domains being successfully mapped into a (hidden) metric space with hyperbolic geometry. Maps have served throughout history as a precise and relevant source of information, at the center of political, economic, and geostrategic decisions. In this thesis, geometric maps of networks play a central role and constitute the underlying thread that weaves the various chapters together. In particular, the work presented in this thesis exploits the current explosion in computing power and the ability of geometric maps to abstract complex topologies in order to unravel fundamental principles underlying the organization and function of real networks.

This thesis starts by introducing complex systems and their mathematical description in terms of networks. In the Preliminary Methods section, we review the S1 and H2 models, which provide a geometric explanation of networks, and discuss the embedding methods used to produce geometric maps. The next four chapters contain the results of our investigations about the structure of and the dynamics on real complex networks. These are organized so that each chapter covers a different topic, while the focus shifts from structure to dynamics traversing through the combination of both. First, we concentrate on structure and devote to the diagnosis of communities through the development of a specialized geometric configuration model, which provides an alternative to the S 1 model for generating random versions of geometric networks. Second, we advance our knowledge on structure by providing a thorough analysis of the hierarchical organization of networks while uncovering mechanisms that favor cooperation in social dilemmas susceptible to stratified order. In chapter three, we further enmesh structure and function by coupling opinion dynamics on a network with its metric structure in order to unravel the multiscale anatomy of opinion formation processes in real systems. In chapter four we fully shift our attention to the dynamics of networks and explore the navigability of time-evolving graphs in hyperbolic space. Finally, we present our conclusions followed by a list of publications related to this thesis.
